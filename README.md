# zoea
An experimental desktop Scuttlebutt client

[Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) is a decentralized social network that I happen to not dislike.

However, it's very much a small, early-adopter, and the available software...kind of reflects that.  I like what's there, but I also want something lighter-weight and a testbed to try out some onboarding methods.

So, _Zoea_ is going to be that testbed.
